[The following discussion presumes that you've already read the "How & Why" pages at the end of the graphic-novel version of the screenplay, and that you've decided, based at least partially on what you read, that you'd like to offer your assistance.]
</i>
</p>
<p>
Hi -- I'm Danny Theodore, the guy who initiated this project (and currently the only member of the "team"). In a few moments I'll describe some ways that you might be able to lend a hand, but first, I want you to be aware that:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  I'm neither a filmmaker nor fabulously wealthy.
  </li>
  <li>
  I don't have the time or experience that would be needed to take the project much beyond its current state -- i.e. to serve for much longer as the project's manager.
  </li>
  <li>
  And last but not least, I have no desire to make a profit either from the project or from anything related, nor do I wish to be compensated even minimally for my "work hours" (although I'd certainly want others to receive compensation if they so desire).
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
Nevertheless, I'm planning to pursue this enterprise until I've exhausted all plausible ways of providing it with the resources -- i.e. the financing and staffing -- that will allow it to proceed to completion. (By "staffing" I mean a filmmaker and a manager for starters, although perhaps they'll be one and the same.)
</p>
<p>
Resources are in fact the most crucial issue for the project overall, at least at this early stage of development, so I'll discuss the topic a bit further here before addressing how you can help. In particular, although the necessary resources can be described fairly easily, actually procuring them turns out to pose a chicken-and-egg-type problem, one that's due mainly to the large expenditure of both time and money that production of the proposed film will involve. The conundrum can be summarized in a single sentence: "Without financing, I won't be able to obtain the support of a filmmaker, but if I don't have the support of a filmmaker, I won't be able to obtain financing." A more detailed summary might be as follows:
</p>
<p>
On the one hand, without significant financing already in place, few if any filmmakers would be willing to participate -- they don't work for free, after all, so it's hard to imagine that they'd willingly incur a serious financial risk. (Moreover, most environmentally-oriented filmmakers appear to have little experience -- or interest -- in producing dramatic content, as most of them appear to work solely on documentaries and such.)
</p>
<p>
Conversely, without the active support of a filmmaker, it's hard to imagine that I could convince potential benefactors to provide financing -- i.e. that they'd accept my assertions as to the "makeability" of the film and the amount of money its production would consume ... or, for that matter, my assertion that I'm even trustworthy at all, given that my professional track record would seem both inaccessible and irrelevant.
</p>
<p>
(I should probably mention, by the way, that crowdfunding doesn't appear to offer a solution, as crowdfunding sites are designed in almost every case to support commercial products as opposed to altruistic endeavors ... and given furthermore that the amount of money needed would be immense, as would the bookkeeping effort if refunds were eventually required.)
</p>
<p>
The end result is that to get the project off the ground, I need to find either a filmmaker or a financial benefactor who's willing to take an initial leap of faith -- i.e. who's:
 <ol>
  <li>
  willing to "get the ball rolling" by making an inital (and perhaps conditional) commitment of time or money, respectively, and who's
  </li>
  <li>
  willing to sing the project's praises in order to help me secure additional funding and/or talent.
  </li>
 </ol>
</p>
<p>
<b>One way you could lend a hand currently</b> would therefore be by helping me find such a filmmaker and/or financial benefactor. You could help, in other words:
 <ul>
  <li>
    by alerting environmentally-conscious filmmakers (if you're acquainted with any) to the existence of this website ... or, if you happen to be an environmentally-conscious filmmaker yourself, by contacting me directly (at the e-mail address I've provided below), and/or
  </li>
  <li>
    by alerting environmentally-conscious institutions, foundations or other organizations (if you're acquainted with any) to the existence of this website ... or, if you happen to be involved in such an organization yourself, by contacting me directly (at the e-mail address I've provided below).
  </li>
 </ul>
</p>
<p>
<b>A second way to help</b> would be by becoming the manager of the project! (As I mentioned at the beginning of this post, I have neither the time nor the experience to do a decent job for much longer, assuming that the project begins to take off.) Please note that the work would be unpaid unless/until financing arrives, at which point you could make your own decision regarding how much compensation you felt you deserved. Please note, furthermore, that I'd be open, participating essentially as an unpaid consultant, to changes of almost any sort that you might wish to make, whether in the screenplay, the movie title, or elsewhere. If you'd like to explore the possibility of becoming manager in more detail, please contact me directly at the e-mail address I've provided below.
</p>
<p>
<b>A third way to help</b> would be by providing suggestions (via e-mail) regarding this page or anything else on the overall website, including the full screenplay, the graphic-novel version, the title of the proposed film, and so forth. (I'm quite willing to contemplate even major changes -- I threw everything in but the kitchen sink, so perhaps the screenplay needs to be trimmed.)
</p>
<p>
<b>A final way to help</b> would be simply by offering encouragement, again via e-mail.
</p>
<p>
Well, that's about it for now .. except that you can send your correspondence to:

Thanks for listening!
