If you haven't read the abridged version of the screenplay, including the "How & Why" pages at the end, please do so before proceeding.

</p>
<p>
Hi -- I'm Danny Theodore, the guy who initiated this project (and currently the only member of the "team"). In a few moments I'll describe several ways that you could provide assistance, but first, I want you to be aware that:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  I'm neither a filmmaker nor fabulously wealthy.
  </li>
  <li>
  I have no desire to profit monetarily from the project or from anything related, nor do I wish to receive even minimal compensation for my "work hours."
  </li>
  <li>
  And last but not least, I don't have the time or experience to serve for much longer as the project's manager.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
Nevertheless (i.e. despite the disclaimers), I'm going to pursue this enterprise until either a) it has enough resources to continue onward on its own (which would be the next major step), or b) I've exhausted all plausible ways of helping it arrive at that point.
</p>
<p>
Okay, with the above as backgound, here's a summary of how you or other interested people could provide assistance:
</p>
<p>
<b>The most beneficial way you could lend a hand</b> would be if you could help me find the necessary resources -- a filmmaker, a financial benefactor, and/or a project manager (see <a href="#resourcediscussion">resource discussion<a> below).
</p>
<p>
<b>A second way of helping</b> would be to volunteer for the role of project manager yourself!
</p>
<p>
<b>A third way of helping</b> would be to provide suggestions (via e-mail; see <a href="#thankyou">below</a>) regarding this page or anything else on the overall website, including the full screenplay, the graphic-novel version, the title of the proposed film, and so forth. (I'm quite willing to contemplate even major changes -- I threw everything in but the kitchen sink, so perhaps the screenplay needs to be trimmed.)
</p>
<p>
<b>A final way of helping</b> would be to simply offer encouragement, again via <a href="#thankyou">e-mail</a>, while perhaps bringing this website to the attention of your friends, family, etc.
</p>
(<a href="#thankyou">skip to the end of the post</a>)

  <b>Resource Discussion</b>
</p>
<p>
Although the necessary resources can be listed rather easily (a project manager, a filmmaker, and financing), actually procuring the latter two turns out to pose a chicken-and-egg type of problem, one that's due mainly to the large amounts of both time and money that would ultimately be consumed during the proposed film's production phase. The conundrum can be summarized in a single sentence: "Without financing, I won't be able to obtain the support of a filmmaker, but if I don't have the support of a filmmaker, I won't be able to obtain financing" ... while a more detailed description might be as follows:
</p>
<p>
On the one hand, without significant financing already in place, few if any filmmakers would be willing to participate -- they don't work for free, after all, so it's hard to imagine that they'd willingly incur a serious financial risk. (Moreover, most environmentally-oriented filmmakers appear to have little experience -- or interest -- in producing dramatic content, as most of them appear to work solely on documentaries and such.)
</p>
<p>
Conversely, without the active support of a filmmaker, it's hard to imagine that I could convince potential benefactors to provide financing -- i.e. that they'd accept my assertions as to the "makeability" of the film and the amount of money its production would consume ... or, for that matter, my assertion that I'm even trustworthy at all, given that my professional track record would seem both inaccessible and irrelevant.
</p>
<p>
(I should probably mention, by the way, that crowdfunding doesn't appear to offer a solution, as crowdfunding sites are designed in almost every case to support commercial products as opposed to altruistic endeavors ... and given furthermore that the amount of money needed would be immense, as would the bookkeeping effort if refunds were eventually required.)
</p>
<p>
The end result is that to get the project off the ground, I need to find either a filmmaker or a financial benefactor who's willing to take an initial leap of faith -- i.e. who's:
 <ol>
  <li>
  willing to "get the ball rolling" by making an inital (and perhaps conditional) commitment of time or money, respectively, and who's
  </li>
  <li>
  willing to sing the project's praises in order to help me secure additional funding and/or talent.
  </li>
 </ol>
</p>
<p>
You could lend a hand currently, therefore:
 <ul>
  <li>
    by alerting environmentally-conscious filmmakers (if you're acquainted with any) to the existence of this website ... or, if you happen to be an environmentally-conscious filmmaker yourself, by contacting me directly (at the e-mail address I've provided below), and/or
  </li>
  <li>
    by alerting environmentally-conscious institutions, foundations or other organizations (if you're acquainted with any) to the existence of this website ... or, if you happen to be involved in such an organization yourself, by contacting me directly (at the e-mail address I've provided below).
  </li>
 </ul>
</p>
<p>
As for finding a project manager, I suspect that the critical attributes would include a sense of excitement about the project and a gift for collaborating effectively with others, while extra points might be awarded if the contender has at least a nodding familiarity with filmmaking and/or non-profit management. Please note that the work would be unpaid pending the arrival of significant financing, at which point the manager could make his/her own decision regarding appropriate levels of compensation. Please note, furthermore, that as an unpaid consultant I'd be open to changes of almost any sort in the content, i.e. in the screenplay, the movie title, or elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
If you or someone else would like to explore the possibility of becoming project manager in more detail, please contact me at the e-mail address I've provided below.
