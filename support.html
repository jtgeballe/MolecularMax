Hi -- I'm Danny Theodore, the guy who started this whole endeavor (and currently the only member of the "team"). In a few moments I'll tell you more about the project, but first I want you to be aware that:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  I'm neither a filmmaker nor fabulously wealthy.
  </li>
  <li>
  I have no desire to profit monetarily from the project or from anything related, nor do I wish to receive even minimal compensation for my work hours.
  </li>
  <li>
  And last but not least, I don't have the time or experience to serve for much longer as the project's driving force and sole advocate.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
Nevertheless (i.e. despite the disclaimers) I'm planning to pursue this enterprise until either a) it has enough resources -- human and financial -- to continue onward on its own, or b) I've exhausted all plausible ways of helping it arrive at that point.
</p>
<p>
Okay, with the above as background, here's further information about the project:
</p>
<p>
<b>General concept</b>
<br>The proposed film would combine animation and live action. It would be appropriate for any audience, but it would be aimed in particular at young people. Specifically, the main (human) character is a young person who experiences events that might -- or might not -- be unfolding within a dream. Later he describes the events to his best friend. The "dream" was orchestrated by a non-human (animated) character with a distinct and rather feisty personality, and with superhero-esque abilities that belie his diminutive stature. A pair of minor twists add a bit of intrigue toward the end of the film.
</p>
<p>
<b>Proposed style and "look"</b>
<br>Perhaps the best model for style would be "Paul" (2011), although I also see a significant resemblance, in terms of both the fundamental concept and the mix of characters, to "Hemo the Magnificent" (1957), which was the second in a series of educational films produced by Bell Laboratories during the late 1950's and early 1960's.
</p>
<p>
<b>Budget</b>
<br>In March 2011 the New York Times reported that the budget for "Paul" was approximately $40 million, of which approximately $15 million was allocated to CGI (computer-generated imagery). These figures imply that the total cost of "Me and Molecular Max" might be somewhere between $5 million and $20 million, assuming that:
<br>
  &nbsp&nbsp- expenses for travel, set construction, etc. will be minimal;
<br>
  &nbsp&nbsp- the amount and complexity of CGI will be considerably less (because "Max" would be  shorter than "Paul," and because there'd be less physical interaction between the animated character and live-action characters);
<br>
  &nbsp&nbsp- the cost of CGI per frame will have decreased (because of more-powerful hardware and software, and because of more experience within the industry);
<br>
  &nbsp&nbsp- only two human actors will be needed (other than a during a brief opening scene); and
<br>
  &nbsp&nbsp- the human actors need not be well-known.
<br>
In addition, since "Max" is intended to benefit the entire planet, perhaps producers, directors and studios would be willing to accept somewhat less than their normal compensation.
</p>
<p>
<b>Prototype pitch deck</b>
<br>A prototype pitch deck is available via email (contact me at the address provided below).
</p>
<p>
<b>What needs to occur next?</b>
<br>The materials I've created would offer inadequate support for a full-scale pitch. In particular,
 <br>
  &nbsp&nbsp- the screenplay/treatment needs to be converted into a standard-format screenplay,
 <br>
  &nbsp&nbsp- a first-approximation budget and schedule need to be developed, and
 <br>
  &nbsp&nbsp- the prototype pitch deck needs to be refined.
<br>
These tasks are beyond my current capabilities, which means that additional resources will be required. At present I can imagine two approaches:
 <br>
  &nbsp&nbsp- contact film-school instructors and propose that they assign the remaining tasks as a "real-world" student project, or
 <br>
  &nbsp&nbsp- prepare a small-scale pitch to fund the initial efforts of a producer(?) and a screenwriter.
<br>
(Of course a third option -- the "hero" scenario -- would be ideal. Imagine, for instance, that someone with a significant background in filmmaking and/or with significant financial resources were to happen across this website, and were to decide, after a thorough review, that he/she wanted to take the project under his/her wing! In such case I would happily cede control of the entire endeavor.)
</p>
<p>
<b>Suggestions and comments welcomed</b>
<br>"Hero" scenario or not, I'm quite willing to contemplate changes -- even major changes -- to the screenplay/treatment, the title of the proposed film, and pretty much anything else.
</p>
